<h2>Tips For How To Become Successful</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Be Commited</dt>
  <dd>-Through commitment, you can gain motivation to pursue success. You should make a list that includes your goal, your level of commitment to the goal and what you are willing to do to achieve that goal. Staying focused on your plan is crucial. It helps to put aside at least 15 minutes per day to think about your plan and work toward it. This will keep your goal fresh in your mind and allow you to continue focusing on it.

    In determining your commitment to your goal, however, it's important to ensure you have realistic expectations of yourself and the outcome. If your commitment is not paying off after a certain period of time, you should adjust your goal accordingly and revise any necessary steps.
    
    At times it may be helpful to ask a friend or family member for support in helping you stick to your commitments. Having someone to hold you accountable for shortcomings and praise your success can really help you stay committed to your goal. </dd>
  <dt>Learn from the journey</dt>
  <dd>- Rather than focusing strictly on the results of your accomplishments, take notice of the small steps needed to achieve success. If you allow yourself to enjoy small victories along your journey, reaching your goal will become a new adventure each day and you will be more likely to stay on track. By doing this, you will learn new and exciting things along the way, which can help you grow as a person.</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Have fun along the way</dt>
<dd>- If the journey to achieve something becomes too tedious, it will be more challenging to succeed. Learning what you are capable of can be fun and exciting, so it is important to keep your goals light and fun in order to have an emotionally-positive experience and keep moving forward without losing perspective.</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Think positively</dt>
<dd>- Developing a positive mindset is all about trusting yourself and your ability to succeed. It is important to replace any negative thoughts with positive ones in order to motivate yourself to keep trying no matter what challenges come your way.

    Think about when babies are learning to walk. They do not stop when they fall. They get back up and keep going until, one day, they are able to move—and soon run—with ease. In your path to become successful, you are likely learning new things and thinking differently than before. Your goals will not happen overnight. They will take practice and discipline to achieve, so it is vital to think about the process positively.</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Change you perspective</dt>
<dd>- Sometimes along the journey, you have to change your perspective to turn a challenging situation into a better one. When you are having a bad day or week, imagine instead that it is a good day or week. Give yourself the opportunity and the time to think about your situation using only positive language and see how much your day or week changes. Doing this for an extended period of time could change your entire life.</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Be honest with yourself</dt>
<dd>- If you find your goal is at a standstill, you might need to be honest with yourself about why that is. After you have come to an understanding, try to find a solution to push yourself toward success. Challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone. This might mean an extra set of squats, speaking to a supervisor about a promotion or even signing up for a difficult college class that you hadn't considered before.</dd>
</dl>
<dt>Take away distractions</dt>
<dd>- Make a list of things in your life that take up your time or distract you. This could be a phone, a television show or even a person who causes you stress. Shut off your phone and put it in a different room when it is time to focus on your goal. Turn off the television and put the remote across the room. Only keep in contact with the people who make a positive impact on your life. Now is the best time to start changing habits so that you can focus on achieving success without distractions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>Keep planning</dt>
    <dd>- Stick to a schedule when working on your goals. Give yourself challenges according to your personal calendar, such as "I will run a seven-minute mile by the end of the month," or "I will save $5,000 by the end of the year." Even if you do not achieve the goal, you will have your starting point in your calendar and will see progress. If you plan your goals and track them in a calendar, you will always have proof of your progress. Having something tangible is a great motivator to keep working toward success.</dd>
