    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.</p>
    <h2>Where?</h2>
    <p>The K-pop singers are currently on a short break and is at their home in South Korea.</p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>BTS's music is also a success because of the subject of their music. While many K-pop songs are about relationships and love, BTS covers subjects that other bands may not like bullying, elitism, and mental health. Their ability to be relatable, humble while still being entertaining is rare.</p>
    <p>With the success of BTS, numerous other KPop groups have since been highlighted internationally; bringing the world of KPop to millions of new fans and to the popularity it holds today. </p>
     <p>BTS has become a global phenomenon and recently claimed the Guinness World Record for the fastest time to reach 1 million followers on the video-sharing platform TikTok.</p>
      <p>Just recently, the members of BTS finally created personal Instagram accounts, and all the members immediately garnered millions of followers.</p>
      <p>When BTS debuted in 2013, Big Hit was an underdog startup in a South Korean music business then dominated by three huge firms (Bang had been a producer for one of them, JYP).</p>    
      <p>A month before BTS's label, Big Hit Entertainment, went public and made its South Korean stock market debut in October 2020, each member of the group was given shares.</p>
      <p>BTS [brought] some early holiday cheer this season with an all-new, festive take on their hit song "Butter."</p>
      <p>BTS have now appeared inside the top 10 on the Hot 100 with nine songs, and they up their total placements anywhere on the chart to 23.</p>
      <p>"I like a lot of BTS music because first, it has an incredible production, often very unusual structures, and different melodies to what I hear." </p>
